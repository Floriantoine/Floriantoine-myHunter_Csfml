## **MY_HUNTER**
"Originally, this Epitech project aimed to create a game in C using the CSFML graphics library. However, recently, I made the decision to migrate to C++ using the sfml library. This transition was intended to simplify the game's launch process through CMake, while eliminating the need to install third-party dependencies. This decision improved the accessibility and portability of the game, while offering a smoother development experience."
